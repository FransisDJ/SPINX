## 🧠 About

SPINX is a portfolio-grade interactive Web3-inspired application built with Vanilla JavaScript, Canvas API, and advanced CSS animation.  
Designed to simulate **real dApp frontend behavior**, not a tutorial project.

## 🔗 Demo vs Real Wallet Mode

- 🧪 **Demo Mode (Live Demo)**  
  Runs without MetaMask for easy access.

- 🦊 **Real MetaMask Mode (Source Code)**  
  Supports wallet detection, connect flow, network handling, and real dApp-style UX.

> Demo mode exists for accessibility. Real Web3 functionality is implemented in the source.
